# TU06. Exercises

## PRE-REQUIREMENTS

- In your course git repository, in the test/business-logic folder, create a folder called **tu06**. It will contain the unit tests that you will create as part of this exercise
- In your course git repository, in the docs folder, create a folder called tu06. It will contain the TU05 functions, modified as per the requirements.

## REQUIREMENTS

- Copy the functions created in TU05 into the docs/tu06 folder
- Remove the manual tests (console logs) that you created; we are going to replace this by automated tests.
- Create 3 test files in the test/business-logic/tu06 folder:
  - 1 file with all the tests for the function of the 1st exercise
  - 1 file with all the tests for the function of the 2nd exercise
  - 1 file with all the tests for the functions of exercise 3 and 4.
- All your exercises must run out of the browser, with node.

## SUGGESTIONS

- Try to use as many concepts as possible. _The exercises are tasks to practice what you have learn._
- Don't use languages structures/concepts that you have not covered yet in the course.

## DELIVERABLES

- <span style="color: tomato;">You must just push your changes to your course's github repository;</span> that's all as I already have a clone of your repository. I will pull your changes as soon as you complete the activity, and I will grade it.
- <span style="color: tomato;">To PASS you need to deliver the 3 test files</span> (no matter if they work or not).
