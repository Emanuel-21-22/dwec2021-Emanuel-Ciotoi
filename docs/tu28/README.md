# TU28. Exercises

## PRE-REQUIREMENTS

- Create a folder in your course git repository called **tu28** inside the docs folder.

## REQUIREMENTS

- Exercises must run out of the browser, with node.
- Write DRY code (DRY stands for: Don't Repeat Yourself)
- <span style="color: tomato;">**Don't validate**</span> your software using JEST.

### EXERCISE 1

Create a `textarea` field that “autosaves” its value on every change.

So, if the user accidentally closes the page, and opens it again, he’ll find his unfinished input at place.

The clear button, clears the value of the textarea and clears the local storage also.

Use the code provided in the templates github repository:

- SSH: [git@github.com:iesme-daw2021/exercises-templates.git](https://github.com/iesme-daw2021/exercises-templates.git)
- HTTPS: <https://github.com/iesme-daw2021/exercises-templates.git>

### EXERCISE 2 (OPTIONAL)

Repeat the previous exercise using cookies. You can use a cookie library, like: <https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie>

## SUGGESTIONS

- Try to use as many theoretical concepts as possible. _The exercises are tasks to practice what you have learn._
- Don't use languages structures/concepts that you have not covered yet in the course.

## DELIVERABLES

- <span style="color: tomato;">You must just push your changes to your course's github repository;</span> that's all as I already have a clone of your repository. I will pull your changes as soon as you complete the activity, and I will grade it.
- <span style="color: tomato;">To PASS you need to deliver all the exercises</span> (no matter if they work or not).
