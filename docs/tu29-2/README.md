# TU29. Exercise 2

## PRE-REQUIREMENTS

- Create a folder in your course git repository called **tu29-2** inside the docs folder.

## REQUIREMENTS

- Exercises must run out of the browser, with node.
- Write DRY code (DRY stands for: Don't Repeat Yourself)
- <span style="color: tomato;">**Don't validate**</span> your software using JEST.

### EXERCISE 1

Using the delay function created in the previous exercise, and the HTML code and its Javascript code to create a span and fulfil it with Loading/Completed/Error, modify that code (a copy of that code) to start showing a 0 and then show every second until 5.

That is: show a 0 initially, after 1 second, show a 1, after 1 second more show a 2, after 1 second more show a 3, and so on, until 5.

Don't catch any error, but handle the error with the _unhundledrejection_ event. In case of unhandled error, just show "Unexpected Error" in the console error.

## SUGGESTIONS

- Try to use as many theoretical concepts as possible. _The exercises are tasks to practice what you have learn._
- Don't use languages structures/concepts that you have not covered yet in the course.

## DELIVERABLES

- <span style="color: tomato;">You must just push your changes to your course's github repository;</span> that's all as I already have a clone of your repository. I will pull your changes as soon as you complete the activity, and I will grade it.
- <span style="color: tomato;">To PASS you need to deliver all the exercises</span> (no matter if they work or not).
