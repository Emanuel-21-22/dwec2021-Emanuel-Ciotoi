# TU16. Exercises

## PRE-REQUIREMENTS

- Create a folder in your course git repository called **tu16** inside the docs folder.

## REQUIREMENTS

- Exercises must run out of the browser, with node.
- Write DRY code (DRY stands for: Don't Repeat Yourself)
- <span style="color: tomato;">**Don't validate**</span> your software using JEST. <span style="color: skyblue;">**Just call the function and watch the console.log.**</span>

### EXERCISE 1

Write a function `printNumbers(from, to)` that outputs (console.log) a number every second, starting from ***from*** and ending with ***to***.

Make two variants of the solution.

1. Using `setInterval`.
1. Using nested `setTimeout`.

```js
// usage:
printNumbers(5, 10);
```

## SUGGESTIONS

- Try to use as many theoretical concepts as possible. *The exercises are tasks to practice what you have learn.*
- Don't use languages structures/concepts that you have not covered yet in the course.

## DELIVERABLES

- <span style="color: tomato;">You must just push your changes to your course's github repository;</span> that's all as I already have a clone of your repository. I will pull your changes as soon as you complete the activity, and I will grade it.
- <span style="color: tomato;">To PASS you need to deliver the exercise</span> (no matter if they work or not).
