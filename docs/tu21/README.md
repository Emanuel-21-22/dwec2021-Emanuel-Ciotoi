# TU21. Events

## PRE-REQUIREMENTS

- Create a folder in your course git repository called **tu21** inside the docs folder.

## REQUIREMENTS

- Exercises must run out of the browser, with node.
- Write DRY code (DRY stands for: Don't Repeat Yourself)
- <span style="color: tomato;">**Don't validate**</span> your software using JEST.

### EXERCISE 1

Add JavaScript to a `button` to make `<div id="text">` disappear when we click it.

Here you have the body of the HTML page:

```html
<input type="button" id="hider" value="Click to hide the text" />
<div id="text">Text</div>
```

### EXERCISE 2

Create a `button` that hides itself on click. Use an arrow function as eventHandler.

Your script tag must be inside the head tag of the HTML. You are not allowed to use "defer".

Here you have the body of the HTML page:

```html
<input type="button" value="Click to hide" />
```

## SUGGESTIONS

- Try to use as many theoretical concepts as possible. _The exercises are tasks to practice what you have learn._
- Don't use languages structures/concepts that you have not covered yet in the course.

## DELIVERABLES

- <span style="color: tomato;">You must just push your changes to your course's github repository;</span> that's all as I already have a clone of your repository. I will pull your changes as soon as you complete the activity, and I will grade it.
- <span style="color: tomato;">To PASS you need to deliver the 2 exercises</span> (no matter if they work or not).
