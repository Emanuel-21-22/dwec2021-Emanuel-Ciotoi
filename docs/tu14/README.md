# TU14. Exercises

## PRE-REQUIREMENTS

- Create a folder in your course git repository called **tu14** inside the docs folder.

## REQUIREMENTS

- Exercises must run out of the browser, with node.
- Write DRY code (DRY stands for: Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Validate your software using JEST.

### EXERCISE 1

Create a function called: `getMostPopulatedCity`, that will receive as a parameter an undetermined number of city objects.

City objects will have two properties: name and population.

The function will calculate the most populated city and it will return the city object.

To resolve the exercise use the spread and the rest operators.

OPTIONAL: You can also use the object destructuring syntax, because the function is going to return the full city object and you just need the city name to check if the function worked as expected.

## SUGGESTIONS

- Try to use as many theoretical concepts as possible. *The exercises are tasks to practice what you have learn.*
- Don't use languages structures/concepts that you have not covered yet in the course.

## DELIVERABLES

- <span style="color: tomato;">You must just push your changes to your course's github repository;</span> that's all as I already have a clone of your repository. I will pull your changes as soon as you complete the activity, and I will grade it.
- <span style="color: tomato;">To PASS you need to deliver the exercise</span> (no matter if they work or not).
