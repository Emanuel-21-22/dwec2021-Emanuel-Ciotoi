# TU29. Exercise 3

## PRE-REQUIREMENTS

- Create a folder in your course git repository called **tu29-3** inside the docs folder.

## REQUIREMENTS

- Exercises must run out of the browser, with node.
- Write DRY code (DRY stands for: Don't Repeat Yourself)
- <span style="color: tomato;">**Don't validate**</span> your software using JEST.

### EXERCISE 1

Rewrite the previous exercise allowing to configure the number of ms between each change of the span text and the number of loops.

For example, 1000ms (1 second), 10 loops; this would mean to show a 0 initially and then 1,2,3 and so on until 10, every second.

But make it in a way that just changing the 2 params to 2000ms and 3 will show 1,2,3 every 2 seconds.

## SUGGESTIONS

- Try to use as many theoretical concepts as possible. _The exercises are tasks to practice what you have learn._
- Don't use languages structures/concepts that you have not covered yet in the course.

## DELIVERABLES

- <span style="color: tomato;">You must just push your changes to your course's github repository;</span> that's all as I already have a clone of your repository. I will pull your changes as soon as you complete the activity, and I will grade it.
- <span style="color: tomato;">To PASS you need to deliver all the exercises</span> (no matter if they work or not).
