# TU31. Exercises

## PRE-REQUIREMENTS

- Create a folder in your course git repository called **tu31** inside the docs folder.

## REQUIREMENTS

- Exercises must run out of the browser, with node.
- Write DRY code (DRY stands for: Don't Repeat Yourself)
- <span style="color: tomato;">**Don't validate**</span> your software using JEST.

### EXERCISE 1

Create web page that obtains your coordinates and shows your position in a map. The position should be updated constantly.

The webpage will contain a button to activate the notifications. Clicking the button will request permission to notify the user.

When the visibility of the webpage changes to not visible, notify the user to click to stop the geolocation. If the user clicks the notification, then the web page should stop geopositioning the user in the map and display a message below the map informing that the active geolocation has stopped.

TIP: You can use the HTML & JS code in the [templates github repository](https://github.com/iesme-daw2021/exercises-templates/), folder tu31, to perform the exercise.

## SUGGESTIONS

- Try to use as many theoretical concepts as possible. _The exercises are tasks to practice what you have learn._
- Don't use languages structures/concepts that you have not covered yet in the course.

## DELIVERABLES

- <span style="color: tomato;">You must just push your changes to your course's github repository;</span> that's all as I already have a clone of your repository. I will pull your changes as soon as you complete the activity, and I will grade it.
- <span style="color: tomato;">To PASS you need to deliver all the exercises</span> (no matter if they work or not).
