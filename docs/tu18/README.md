# TU18. Exercises

## PRE-REQUIREMENTS

- Create a folder in your course git repository called tu18 inside the docs folder.

## REQUIREMENTS

- Exercises must run out of the browser, with node.
- Write DRY code (DRY stands for: Don't Repeat Yourself)
- <span style="color: tomato;">**Don't validate**</span> your software using JEST.

### EXERCISE 1

Look at this page:

```html
<html>
<body>
  <div>Users:</div>
  <ul>
    <li>John</li>
    <li>Pete</li>
  </ul> 
</body>
</html>
```

For each of the following, give at least one way of how to access them:

- The `<div>` DOM node?
- The `<ul>` DOM node?
- The second `<li>` (with Pete)?

## SUGGESTIONS

- Try to use as many theoretical concepts as possible. *The exercises are tasks to practice what you have learn.*
- Don't use languages structures/concepts that you have not covered yet in the course.

## DELIVERABLES

- <span style="color: tomato;">You must just push your changes to your course's github repository;</span> that's all as I already have a clone of your repository. I will pull your changes as soon as you complete the activity, and I will grade it.
- <span style="color: tomato;">To PASS you need to deliver the exercise</span> (no matter if they work or not).
